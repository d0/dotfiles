	Stand rund um das Thema WMNs.
	
	
	Im Bereich Sicherheit stellen die Autoren fest, dass es noch keine
	zufriedenstellenden Lösungen gibt. Bezüglich des zentralisierten
	Ansatzes argumentieren sie, dass wmn verteilte Netze sind -- eine
	neue Netzwerkarchitektur.
	
	
	Auf Seite 29 gehts um Sicherheit. Hier werden einzelne Gefahren und
	Angriffe kurz erläutert und an manchen Stellen einige Lösungen erwähnt.},

	NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet
	
	Protocol version 6 address family. NTPv4 includes fundamental
	
	improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend
	
	the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern
	
	workstations and fast LANs. It includes a dynamic server discovery
	
	scheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not
	
	required. It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and
	
	implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism.},

  title = {Key Managament for Heterogeneous Ad Hoc Wireless Networks},
  year = {2002},
  abstract = {PKI has been recognized as one of the most successful and important
	tools for providing security for
	
	dynamic networks. However, providing such infrastructure in ad hoc
	wireless networks is a challenging
	
	task due to the infrastructure-less nature of ad hoc networks. In
	this paper, we present these challenges in
	
	detail, identify the requirements for such solutions in ad hoc networks,
	and propose a practical solution
	
	to provide certification services in ad hoc networks. We employ threshold
	cryptography to distribute
	
	the CA functionality over specially selected nodes based on security
	and physical characteristics of the
	
	nodes. The selected mobile nodes that collectively provide PKI functionality
	are called MOCA(MObile
	
	Certificate Authority)s. Using these MOCAs, we present an efficient
	yet effective communication pro-
	
	tocol for mobile nodes to correspond with MOCAs and get certification
	services. Results from our
	
	simulations verify the effectiveness of our approach, as well as the
	cost in terms of control overhead and
	
	delay. we also provide some insights into configuring such security
	services.},

@ARTICLE{Zhou1999,

  title = {Securing Ad Hoc Networks},
  journal = {IEEE network},
  year = {1999},
  abstract = {Ad hoc networks are a new wireless networking paradigm for mobile
	hosts. Unlike traditional mobile
	
	wireless networks, ad hoc networks do not rely on any fixed infrastructure.
	Instead, hosts rely on each
	
	other to keep the network connected. The military tactical and other
	security-sensitive operations are
	
	still the main applications of ad hoc networks, although there is
	a trend to adopt ad hoc networks
	
	for commercial uses due to their unique properties. One main challenge
	in design of these networks is
	
	their vulnerability to security attacks. In this paper, we study the
	threats an ad hoc network faces and
	
	the security goals to be achieved. We identify the new challenges
	and opportunities posed by this new
	
	networking environment and explore new approaches to secure its communication.
	In particular, we take
	
	advantage of the inherent redundancy in ad hoc networks — multiple
	routes between nodes — to defend
	
	routing against denial of service attacks. We also use replication
	and new cryptographic schemes, such
	
	as threshold cryptography, to build a highly secure and highly available
	key management service, which
	
	forms the core of our security framework.},
