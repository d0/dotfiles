Use `make all` to build OpenSSL with OpenPACE.

If you choose to patch and build OpenSSL by yourself, make sure to to configure
OpenSSL with PACE support, i.e.:
    ./configure experimental-pace

After building OpenPACE you can use the included pacetest program in the test
directory to see if everything is working correctly.


WINDOWS
=======

Compiling with Visual C++ is supported and tested. You will additionally need
perl, for example from here http://strawberryperl.com/.

Open a VC command prompt, go to your OpenSSL patched with OpenPACE and run the
following commands:
1. perl Configure experimental-pace VC-WIN32 no-asm --prefix=c:\openssl
2. ms\do_ms.bat
3. nmake -f ms\nt.mak install

MSVC 2010 Visual Studio ships with stdint.h, which is needed for OpenPACE. If
you are using an older version you should to get an additional header file, for
example from here
http://msinttypes.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/stdint.h
